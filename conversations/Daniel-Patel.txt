Thank you for calling Guardian Investment Services, this is Rachel speaking. How may I help you today?
Hi Rachel, this is Daniel Patel again. I'm calling to check on those wire transfers we discussed a few days ago.
Mr. Patel, yes of course. Let me verify your information quickly if you don't mind. Could you please provide your account number and the last four digits of your Social Security number?
Sure, my account number is 775-90142, and the last four of my SSN are 6589.
Thank you for verifying that information, Mr. Patel. I see you spoke with our priority review team and those larger transfers have been cleared. I'm glad to see they've all been processed now. Are you calling about one of those transactions?
Yes, actually. I made another wire transfer yesterday for $28,000 to one of my suppliers, and I wanted to make sure it's processing correctly given what happened with the others. I can't afford another delay.
I completely understand your concern after what happened. Let me check that for you... Yes, I can see the new transfer you initiated yesterday. This one doesn't have any compliance flags on it, and wire transfers typically take 24-48 business hours to complete processing. Since you just made it yesterday, it should clear by tomorrow without any issues.
That's good to hear. My supplier is really expecting that payment soon, and after what happened last time, I'm a bit anxious about every transfer now.
That's completely understandable, Mr. Patel. I can see here that our review team also approved a reimbursement for those overdraft fees you incurred during the delay. That credit of $225 should appear in your account by the end of this week.
I appreciate that. By the way, I was also looking at my last statement and noticed the monthly service fee on my business account seemed higher than usual.
Let me look into that for you as well. Yes, I do see that your fee was $45 rather than the usual $15. It looks like your average daily balance fell below the minimum threshold of $25,000 for about a week last month. That happened right around the time of those delayed transfers, which likely contributed to the problem.
I wasn't aware of that. Given everything that's happened with those delayed transfers, is there any way to have that fee waived?
Absolutely, Mr. Patel. Considering the circumstances with those delayed transfers affecting your balance, I'd be happy to waive that fee immediately. In fact, I'll take care of that right now. There we goâ€”the $45 fee has been credited back to your account.
Thank you, I really appreciate that, Rachel. And, um... about those account closure forms you sent. I think I'm going to hold off on that for now, since things seem to be getting resolved.
I'm very glad to hear that, Mr. Patel. We truly value your business and I'm relieved we were able to correct these issues for you. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
No, that's all for now. Thanks again for your help with everything.
Thank you for calling Guardian Investment Services, Mr. Patel. We appreciate your patience through this process. Have a wonderful day.
